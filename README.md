# Crypto Clustering Analysis

This project utilizes unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency market data. The goal is to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their price changes over different time frames using **K-Means Clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.

## Project Overview

This analysis helps in identifying patterns in the cryptocurrency market by:
- Standardizing the data for effective clustering.
- Using the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Applying **K-Means Clustering** to group cryptocurrencies based on market trends.
- Reducing dimensionality with **PCA** to optimize clustering.
- Visualizing the results using **hvPlot**.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For StandardScaler, K-Means Clustering, and PCA.
- **hvPlot**: Interactive visualization of clustered cryptocurrencies.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Running and organizing the analysis.
